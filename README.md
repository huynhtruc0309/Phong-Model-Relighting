# relighting-ujm

## 3 June 2024
Note:
- Searching for paper in relighting focusing on image processing and colorimetry
- Present a list of approaches on Wednesday
- Make a google slide
- An approach that is lite
- Working hours: 9am-5pm

Category:
- Face relighting
- Fullbody relighting
- General Relighting
- Material Relighting
- Portrait Relighting

Compare base on availability, inference time
